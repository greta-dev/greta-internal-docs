# What are "forward", "sampling", and "hybrid" modes?

> Forward is called when doing inference, or when doing calculate deterministically (nsim=NULL) because there's no stochasticity in the algorithm, you start with the free state, and you push through all the deterministic operations
 
> Sampling mode is when variables are sampled from their distributions (or specified by the user)
 
> Hybrid mode is the awkward situation when doing posterior predictive simulation. It's forward mode pushing through deterministically from the pre-computed MCMC samples, but then sampling some new variables from their distributions conditional on that
